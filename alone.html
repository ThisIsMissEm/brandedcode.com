    <h2>Alone. Quiet. Sometimes we just want to be left alone. To think. To reminisce. We're neither happy or sad, angry or upset, depressed or suicidal.</h2>
    <p>We just want to be left alone. We're not throwing away years of work, or our entire lives. We're just thinking. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be left alone. It's natural, we all need a bit of time out every now and then. Life is a drug, it has high points, then you have the crash, and then you take it all over again, just for the thrill of it.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's good to step back from it all.</p>
    <p>Step back, to think, to reflect, to mature and find ourselves. We don't hate you, we don't dislike you, it's just that we want to be left alone. It sometimes gets hard to love you, but we still do. This is life.</p>
    <p>If we stay up all night, or spend all day quiet in our rooms, it's because we're thinking. We just want that pure raw silence. That silence of solitary thinking. It's not that we're sad, angry, depressed or lonely, we just wish to be left alone.</p>
    <p>When your heart feels empty and your mind is numb, you've had your fill and you need to refresh. Just give us some time to overcome the things on our minds. Let us soar freely, don't try to protect us, let us florish in silence. We will wallow in the deepest depths of our minds, we will think our lives through. We may cry or get angry at the hard parts, we may laugh or simile at the good times. There's a world inside our minds, and it needs us to discover it. There's something in there, someone in there; some places in there are dark, others bright.</p>
    <p>The mind is the heart of the soul, it's an entire universe large. Sometimes we get lost in it, at other times we just need to get inside of it. Part of growing up is coming to understand our minds. We need to understand what makes us sad, what makes us happy, what makes us human. We all have ups and downs, that's the rollercoaster of life.</p>
    <p>The night is quiet, the air is fresh. The night is alone, we can think. There's nothing there, except for the shadows and darkness, but there's brightness inside of us &ndash; we just need to find it. The colours of night are blues, blacks and deep purples and greens. It is not a bad time, it is a time of discovery. It is just a quiet time. It is a time to think, and a time to be alone.</p>
    <p>Within our minds, we think of a lot of things. Things that collectively we can call us or our life. We think about the good times. We think about the bad times. We think about the past times and the sad times. We think of the future time, and the varied times ahead of us. We think about gender, race and sexuality. We think about place, location, and age. We think about love, hate, and relationships. The air is cool, the noise is nil, we can think about things not mentioned by day. We can question everything about ourselves, and in the end, we come out stronger, and more mature than before. We mustn't fear the dark times, as there are many lighter times ahead of us.</p>
    <p>As with all good pieces of writing, this will remain unfinished&hellip;</p>
