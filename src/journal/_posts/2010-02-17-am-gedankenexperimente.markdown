title: Gedanken-Experimente 
---

It was a summers day, the wind blowing a light breeze outside to cool the air, leaves moving slightly on their branches. Inside, it was a physics classroom. The teacher, talking of Einstein, his thought experiments, and how he came to discover his theory of relativity. Me, I had my sketchbook out, the brain ticking away over ideas, and then a thought that's never occurred to me before appear, and that thought was:

> Design is very similar to a thought experiment.

So, what is a *gedankenexperimente*, it&apos;s a way of thinking about a problem. Often, you adjust your focus and perspective on the issue until you have a very clear idea &mdash; one with a single purpose.

Over the next few weeks, I pondered over the idea of a thought experiment being used to design or develop something. I tried it out a a fair few times, and each time, the ideas began to grow and evolve in to something strong and pure. It all starts with a seed, an idea, nothing super significant, just an idea. That seed then sits in the depths of your mind, waiting for it's moment to sprout, as if in hibernation.

Once the seed has grown, you try to quickly get all of the idea out of your head and down somewhere more permanent, possibly much like what Einstein would have done after his own *gedankenexperimente eureka!*

Slowly, I became conscious of how a thought experiment works and evolves. Now that I understand how they work, I can share with out how a thought experiment works, and the process I use:

1. Take an idea.
2. Think about it a little, but don't focus too hard on it.
3. Go and do some other things for a while.
4. Slowly craft a clearer picture of the original idea.
5. With your ideas, apply all the variables, play with the available perspectives, shift your focus between the individual elements of your problem.
6. Begin to take your ideas and construct something out of them.

There you have it, the very small and simple steps of a thought experiment. Most creatives will have many of these over a day, a week, or several week period, generally without even noticing it. It's a natural process, it's something that we do without our invention. However, with a little intervention, you can refine and shape how you perform a *thought experiment
*.

What do you think of thought experiments, would you use them?
