title: Just Say Thanks.
---

It&apos;s something I&apos;ve been thinking about for a while, but isn&apos;t it rather sad that rarely today do we see people just saying a simple *thanks*.

Say thanks to those who make a product or service that you use, say thanks for that link that someone shared with you, or that grand piece of work and possible inspiration that you saw on *[dribbble](http://dribbble.com)*. You could also say thanks to the producers of that [awesome](http://thechangelog.com) [podcast](http://carsonified.com/blog/category/tvr/) you listen to.

So if you&apos;ve said *thanks* to somebody today, give yourself a pat on the back.
