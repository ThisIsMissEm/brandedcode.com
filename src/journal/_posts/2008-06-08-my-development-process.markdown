title: My Development Process
---

Recently there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about the flow of development different companies use in order to make websites or applications. From the [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop) team, we had the process of:

1. Paper Sketches
2. <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>

This is almost similar to the process I use, however I introduce another step; But before I get to that, I&#8217;ll explain traditional, and possibly most well known method. It goes something like this:

1. Brain Storming
2. Rough Paper Sketches
3. Refined Sketches
4. Photoshop mockup
5. Prototyping in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr>
6. Full production development

This process has worked for different people for a number of reasons, for one, it&#8217;s well structured and gives plenty of time for thought. Two, It&#8217;s a way to collect and streamline thoughts before actually starting anything in hard code or pen on paper.

I can&#8217;t say i&#8217;ve found this method to ever work very well for me; I&#8217;ve tried to use it a few times, not because i suck at photoshop, but because i like to be too precise, there&#8217;s too much detail i can put into a drawing. A sketch on the other hand, i can easily change, modify and rearrange. My Process goes something like this:

1. Research and Inspire
2. Rough paper sketches
3. Dimension sizes of things on using tracing paper.
4. Work from paper straight into <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> templates
5. Add in server side code and javascript as required.

The reasons this works for me is because before i start anything, i make sure i have very clean, clear and good looking sketches, this means the the photoshop stage is pretty much in the sketch stage. Then I just take a step to the right, and go straight into the code, head first. What are your thoughts on the process? Do you work similar to me, or how do you work?
