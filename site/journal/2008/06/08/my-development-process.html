				<div class="content">
					<p>Recently there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about the flow of development different companies use in order to make websites or applications. From the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop">37signals</a> team, we had the process of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Paper Sketches</li>
<li><abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr></li>
</ol>


<p>This is almost similar to the process I use, however I introduce another step; But before I get to that, I&#8217;ll explain traditional, and possibly most well known method. It goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Brain Storming</li>
<li>Rough Paper Sketches</li>
<li>Refined Sketches</li>
<li>Photoshop mockup</li>
<li>Prototyping in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr></li>
<li>Full production development</li>
</ol>


<p>This process has worked for different people for a number of reasons, for one, it&#8217;s well structured and gives plenty of time for thought. Two, It&#8217;s a way to collect and streamline thoughts before actually starting anything in hard code or pen on paper.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say i&#8217;ve found this method to ever work very well for me; I&#8217;ve tried to use it a few times, not because i suck at photoshop, but because i like to be too precise, there&#8217;s too much detail i can put into a drawing. A sketch on the other hand, i can easily change, modify and rearrange. My Process goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Research and Inspire</li>
<li>Rough paper sketches</li>
<li>Dimension sizes of things on using tracing paper.</li>
<li>Work from paper straight into <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</abbr> + <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> templates</li>
<li>Add in server side code and javascript as required.</li>
</ol>


<p>The reasons this works for me is because before i start anything, i make sure i have very clean, clear and good looking sketches, this means the the photoshop stage is pretty much in the sketch stage. Then I just take a step to the right, and go straight into the code, head first. What are your thoughts on the process? Do you work similar to me, or how do you work?</p>
